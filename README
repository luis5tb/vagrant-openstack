To create the VMs:
 - vagrant up

Note, if this does not work due to virtualbox kernel modules, install dkms and load the kernel module:
 - yum/dnf/apt-get install dkms
 - /usr/lib/vitualbox/vboxdrv.sh setup
 - try again the creation command: vagrant up

This creates a controller and a worker VM. To log in into them:
 - vagrant ssh controller
 - vagrant ssh worker

To start playing with openstack:
 - vagrant ssh controller
 - cd devstack
 - . openrc admin admin
 - and play

To suspend the VMs:
 - vagrant suspend [controller|worker]

Restart them:
  - vagrant up [controller|worker]
  - vagrant ssh [controller|worker]
  - cd devstack
  - . openrc admin admin
  - and play

To remove the VMs:
 - vagrant destroy [controller|worker]
